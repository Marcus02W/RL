# Repo content
Repository featuring the visual evaluation notebook of the RL project of Marcus and Lukas (WWI21DSB). <br><br>
In general the project has been about tuning, training and evaluating a DQN and a SAC model on the highway-env environment (https://highway-env.farama.org/index.html) as well as comparing their performance.

#### IMPORTANT: The other notebooks are located on Kaggle since hyperparametertuning and training have been done there.

#### The train notebooks do not feature any graphics visualizing training progression. We have decided to log all that data and integrate a wandb callback to create a broad range of visual training insights in a central and persistent place. Links to wandb spaces are listed below.

# DQN
##### Parameter tuning notebook: 
##### Graphics for tuning runs: https://wandb.ai/w02marcus/dqn_tuning_RL?nw=nwuserw02marcus
##### Final training notebook:
##### Graphics for final training: https://wandb.ai/w02marcus/sac_final_training?nw=nwuserw02marcus (both are in one place for comparison despite the sac in the name)
